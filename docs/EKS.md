    configuration:
      placement:
        availabiltyZone: "us-west-2a"
        hostResourceGroupArn: "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:1234456789:group/host-group-name"
        tenancy: "host"
```

```yaml
spec:
  provisioner: eks
  eks:
    type: LaunchConfiguration # can be omitted as the default
    configuration:
      placement:
        tenancy: "host"
```

## Upgrade Strategies

An 'upgrade' is needed when a change is made to an instance-group which requires node rotation in order to take effect, for example the AMI has changed.
instance-manager currently supports two types of upgrade strategy, `rollingUpdate` and `crd`.

### Rolling Update Strategy

rollingUpdate is a basic implementation of a rolling instance replacement - you can define `maxUnavailable` to some number or percent that represents the desired capacity to be rotated at a time.

```yaml
apiVersion: instancemgr.keikoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: InstanceGroup
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: instance-manager
spec:
  strategy:
    type: rollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 30%
```

### CRD Strategy

The second strategy is `crd` which allows for adding custom behavior via submission of custom resources.

There might be cases where you would want to implement custom behavior as part of your upgrade, this can be achieved by the `crd` strategy - it allows you to create any custom resource and watch it for a success condition.

In the below example, we submit an [argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo) workflow as a response to an upgrade events, but you can submit any kind of resource you wish, such as [upgrade-manager](https://github.com/keikoproj/upgrade-manager)'s RollingUpgrade.

```yaml
apiVersion: instancemgr.keikoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: InstanceGroup
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: instance-manager
spec:
  strategy:
    type: crd
    crd:
      crdName: workflows
      statusJSONPath: .status.phase
      statusSuccessString: Succeeded
      statusFailureString: Failed
      concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
      spec: |
        apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Workflow
        metadata:
          generateName: hello-world-parameters-
        spec:
          entrypoint: whalesay
          arguments:
            parameters:
            - name: message
              value: hello world
          templates:
          - name: whalesay
            inputs:
              parameters:
              - name: message
            container:
              image: docker/whalesay
              command: [cowsay]
              args: ["echo", "{{ .InstanceGroup.Status.ActiveScalingGroupName }}"]
```

#### Recovering from Upgrade Failures

You can configure whether you want the controller to retry by setting the `spec.strategy.crd.maxRetries` field - if left unset it will default to 3, max retries can also be set to -1 which would retry until success.
When the submitted resource fails, the controller will delete/recreate the resource up to configured amount of times, once the max retries are met, the instance-group will enter an error state and requeue with exponential backoff.
In order to manually retry, you must delete the failed custom resource and either wait for the next reconcile, or trigger a reconcile by making a modifications to the instance group or restarting the controller.

## Spot instances

You can switch to spot instances in two ways:

- Manually set the `spec.eks.configuration.spotPrice` to a spot price value, if the price is available, the instances will rotate, if the price is no longer available, it's up to you to change it to a different value.

- Use a spot recommendation controller such as [minion-manager](https://github.com/keikoproj/minion-manager), instance-manager will look at events published with the following message format:

```json
{"apiVersion":"v1alpha1","spotPrice":"0.0067", "useSpot": true}
```

In addition, the event `involvedObject.name`, must be the name of the autoscaling group to switch, and the event `.reason` must be `SpotRecommendationGiven`.

When recommendations are not available (no events for an hour / recommendation controller is down), instance-group will retain the last provided configuration, until a human either changes back to on-demand (by setting `spotPrice: ""`) or until recommendation events are found again.

## Customize Scaling Group

You can customize specific attributes of the scaling group

### EBS Volumes

You can customize EBS volumes as follows

```yaml
apiVersion: instancemgr.keikoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: InstanceGroup
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: instance-manager
spec:
  provisioner: eks
  eks:
    configuration:
      volumes:
      - name: /dev/xvda
        type: gp2
        size: 50
      - name: /dev/xvdb
        type: gp2
        size: 100
```

You can customize scaling group's collected metrics as follows

```yaml
apiVersion: instancemgr.keikoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: InstanceGroup
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: instance-manager
spec:
  provisioner: eks
  eks:
    configuration:
      metricsCollection:
      - GroupMinSize
      - GroupMaxSize
      # you can also reference "All" to collect all metrics
```

You can customize scaling group's suspended processes as follows

```yaml
apiVersion: instancemgr.keikoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: InstanceGroup
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: instance-manager
spec:
  provisioner: eks
  eks:
    configuration:
      suspendProcesses:
      - AZRebalance
      # you can also reference "All" to suspend all processes
```

## GitOps/Platform support, boundaries, default and conditional values

In order to support use-cases around GitOps or platform management, the controller allows operators to define 'boundaries' of configurations into `restricted` and `shared` configurations, along with the default values to enforce.

`shared` fields can be referenced with a `merge`, `mergeOverride` or `replace` directive, which provide controls over how default values should be combined with the resource values. `merge` will provide a simple merge, if there is a conflict between the default value and the resource value, the resource value will not be allowed to override the default, for example consider the following default / resource values.

```yaml
# default values
tags:
- key: tag-A
  value: value-A
- key: tag-B
  value: value-B

# resource values
tags:
- key: tag-A
  value: value-D
- key: tag-C
  value: value-C
```

If `spec.eks.configuration.tags` was referenced as a `merge` field the result would be:

```yaml
tags:
- key: tag-A
  value: value-A
- key: tag-B
  value: value-B
- key: tag-C
  value: value-C
```

`mergeOverride` allows the CR to override the default will have a different result:

```yaml
tags:
- key: tag-A
  value: value-D
- key: tag-B
  value: value-B
- key: tag-C
  value: value-C
```

`replace` would allow the CR to completely replace the default values:

```yaml
tags:
- key: tag-A
  value: value-D
- key: tag-C
  value: value-C
```

For example, if you'd like your cluster tenants to only be able to control certain fields such as `minSize`, `maxSize`, `instanceType`, `labels` and `tags` while the rest is controlled via the operator you could achieve this by creating a config-map the defines these boundaries.

By default the controller watches configmaps with the name `instance-manager` in the namespaace `instance-manager`, namespace can be customized via a controller flag `--config-namespace`.

- Configurations without a boundary means it must be provided in the custom resource.
- Configurations with a shared boundary means the controller will try to merge a default value with the custom resource provided value.
- Configurations with a restricted boundary means the controller will give first priority to the default value, and will fall back on a custom resource provided value if the default is missing.

For enforcing the above described conditions, the configmap should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: instance-manager
  namespace: instance-manager
data:
  boundaries: |
    shared:
      merge:
      - spec.eks.configuration.labels
      mergeOverride:
      - spec.eks.configuration.tags
      replace:
      - spec.eks.strategy
    restricted:
    - spec.eks.configuration.clusterName
    - spec.eks.configuration.image
    - spec.eks.configuration.roleName
    - spec.eks.configuration.instanceProfileName
    - spec.eks.configuration.keyPairName
    - spec.eks.configuration.securityGroups
    - spec.eks.configuration.subnets
    - spec.eks.configuration.taints
  defaults: |
    spec:
      provisioner: eks
      eks:
        configuration:
          clusterName: a-managed-cluster
          subnets:
          - subnet-1234
          - subnet-2345
          - subnet-3456
          keyPairName: a-managed-keypair
          image: ami-1234
          labels:
            a-default-label: "true"
          taints:
          - key: default-taint
            value: a-taint
            effect: NoSchedule
          roleName: a-managed-role
          instanceProfileName: a-managed-profile
          tags:
          - key: a-default-tag
            value: a-default-value
          securityGroups:
          - sg-1234
```

The user (or GitOps) can now submit a shortened custom resource that looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: instancemgr.keikoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: InstanceGroup
metadata:
  name: my-instance-group
  namespace: instance-manager
spec:
  eks:
    minSize: 2
    maxSize: 4
    configuration:
      labels:
        test-label: "true"
      instanceType: t2.small
      tags:
      - key: tag-key
        value: tag-value
```

The resulting scaling group will be a result of merging the shared values, and prefering the restricted values.

Any update to the configmap will trigger a reconcile for instancegroups which are aligned with a non-matching configuration.

This is enforced via the `status.configMD5` field, which has an MD5 hash of the last seen configmap data, this guarantees consistency with the values defined in the configmap.

This also makes upgrades easier across a managed cluster, an operator can now simply modify the default value for `image` and trigger an upgrade across all instance groups.

Individual namespaces can opt-out by adding the annotation `instancemgr.keikoproj.io/config-excluded=true`, this is useful for system namespaces which may need to override a global restrictive configuration, e.g. subnet, while keeping the boundary as is for other namespaces - adding this annotation to a namespace will opt-out all instancegroups under the namespace from using the cluster configuration.


### Conditional defaults
For more complex setups, such as clusters that have InstanceGroups that have different architectures, operating systems, etc - it might be 
desirable to conditionally apply default values. Conditional default values can be added, as seen in the example below:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: instance-manager
  namespace: instance-manager
data:
  boundaries: |
    shared:
      merge:
      - spec.eks.configuration.labels
      mergeOverride:
      - spec.eks.configuration.tags
      replace:
      - spec.eks.strategy
    restricted:
    - spec.eks.configuration.image
  defaults: |
    spec:
      provisioner: eks
      eks:
        configuration:
          image: ami-x86linux
  conditionals: |
    - annotation: 'instancemgr.keikoproj.io/os-family = windows'
      defaults:
       spec:
         eks:
           configuration:
             image: ami-windows
    - annotationSelector: 'instancemgr.keikoproj.io/arch = arm64,instancemgr.keikoproj.io/os-family = bottlerocket'
      defaults:
       spec:
         eks:
           configuration:
             image: ami-bottlerocketArm
```

The `annotationSelector` field accepts a selector string, which follows the semantics of the Kubernetes [field selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/field-selectors/). 
This selector is applied against the annotations of InstanceGroup objects. When a selector matches an InstanceGroup, the `defaults` associated with it are applied to the InstangeGroup, taking precedence over the non-conditional 
default values. Conditional rules are applied in-order from the beginning of the list to the end - meaning that the last applicable rule will apply in case of conflicts. 

The following operators are supported:
```
<selector-syntax>         ::= <requirement> | <requirement> "," <selector-syntax>
<requirement>             ::= [!] KEY [ <set-based-restriction> | <exact-match-restriction> ]
<set-based-restriction>   ::= "" | <inclusion-exclusion> <value-set>
<inclusion-exclusion>     ::= <inclusion> | <exclusion>
<exclusion>               ::= "notin"
<inclusion>               ::= "in"
<value-set>               ::= "(" <values> ")"
<values>                  ::= VALUE | VALUE "," <values>
<exact-match-restriction> ::= ["="|"=="|"!="] VALUE
```
## Annotations

| Annotation Key | Object | Annotation Value | Purpose |
|:--------------:|:------:|:----------------:|:-------:|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/config-excluded|Namespace|"true"|settings this annotation on a namespace will allow opt-out from a configuration configmap, all instancegroups under such namespace will not use configmap boundaries and default values|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/cluster-autoscaler-enabled|InstanceGroup|"true"|setting this annotation to true will add the relevant cluster-autoscaler EC2 tags according to cluster name, taints, and labels|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/irsa-enabled|InstanceGroup|"true"|setting this annotation to true will remove the AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy from the default managed policies attached to the node role, this should only be used when nodes are using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) and the aws-node daemonset is using an IRSA role which contains this policy|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/os-family|InstanceGroup|either "windows", "bottlerocket", or "amazonlinux2" (default)|this is required if you are running a windows or bottlerocket based AMI, by default the controller will try to bootstrap an amazonlinux2 AMI|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/default-labels|InstanceGroup|comma-seprarated key-value string e.g. "label1=value1,label2=value2"|allows overriding the default node labels added by the controller, by default the role label is added depending on the cluster version|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/custom-networking-enabled|InstanceGroup|"true"|setting this annotation to true will automatically calculate the correct setting for max pods and pass it to the kubelet|
|instancemgr.keikoproj.io/custom-networking-host-pods|InstanceGroup|"2"|setting this annotation increases the number of max pods on nodes with custom networking, due to the fact that hostNetwork pods do not use an additional IP address |
