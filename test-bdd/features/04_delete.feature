  As an EKS cluster operator
  I need to delete the custom resource

    And I delete a resource instance-group-managed.yaml

  Scenario: Delete an instance-group with rollingUpdate strategy
    Given an EKS cluster
    When I delete a resource instance-group.yaml
    Then 0 nodes should be found
    And the resource should be deleted

    Given an EKS cluster
    When I delete a resource instance-group-crd.yaml
    Then 0 nodes should be found
    And the resource should be deleted
